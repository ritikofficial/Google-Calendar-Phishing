# Google-Calendar-Phishing
This is our Ethical Hacking (C S 378) final project.
It is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.
This project was meant to demonstrate proof of concept of a phishing attack.
It should not be used as an actual phishing attack.


# Setup
The following environment variables need to be set up:

APP_SETTINGS: This should be 'config.DevelopmentConfig' in development

CLIENT_SECRET: This is the Google OAuth Client Secret JSON (the entire string)

FLASK_SECRET_KEY: This can be any secret key you choose. Flask just uses it to maintain sessions

DATABASE_URL: This is the complete url to the database, which must be a postgresql database. For development, you'll likely be connecting to a local database with the format 'postgresql://[user]:[password]@localhost:5432/[database_name]'


To install Python dependencies, run the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run migrations for the database, run the following command:
```
python manage.py db upgrade
```

To run the app locally, run the following command:
```
python server.py
```
